# Cookie Base 

## Ingredients 

- 200 grams of unsalted butter 

- 100 grams of granulated white sugar 

- 180 grams of dark brown sugar 

- 10 millitters of vanilla extract 

- 6 grams of salt 

- 1 large egg 

- 1 large egg yolk 

- 210 grams of all purpose flour 

- 2 grams of baking soda 

 

## Steps 

1. Take 140 grams of unsalted butter and melt it in a sauce pan on medium heat making sure to stir to avoid burning. The goal is to get it to a brown bronze state where it smells nutty. 

2. Off the heat add the remaining 60 grams of unsalted butter to the browned butter until completely melted. 

3. Whisk together the white granulated sugar, darkbrown sugar, vanilla extract, and salt untill there are no lumps remaining.  

4. Whisk in one large egg and one large egg yolk until incorporated.  

5. Let rest for 3 minutes and whisk again for 30 seconds, repeating this step 2 more times until mixture is thick, smooth, and shiny. 

6. In a seperate bowl mix the flour and baking soda together. 

7. Hand stir the dry mix with the wet mix until just combined 

8. (Optional) Stir in any mix-ins. (general rule to follow is 150g to 200g of total mix ins) 

9. (Recomended) Chill mixture for at least 20 minutes up to 72 hours. (the longer the more flavor is developed) 

10. Scoop out 35 to 40g of cookie dough and form into balls, spaced by at least an inch appart. 

11. Preheat oven to 375F and bake for 10-14 minutes or until golden brown around the edges.
